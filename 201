Hello guys, this is a new guide that I have created for those who are interested in taking the 201 - TMOS Administration exam of F5 Networks. 
This guide is based on blueprint version 13.1 described in the article K29900360. I hope this helps you and if you have any doubt about a 
specific subject, feel free to ping me or write a note on the article. Good luck!!!
